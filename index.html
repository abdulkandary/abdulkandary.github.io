        <p>
          I’ve spent most of my adult life navigating my passions in both the arts and the sciences.
          I began my research journey in materials science in 2015 and have nurtured a deep curiosity for the field ever since.
          My natural meditative state peaks when connecting with another biological being — reflecting on how my own ceramic- and fiber-reinforced polymer and
          lipid matrix, i.e., body, undergoes the same biochemical reactions.

          My research objective is to engineer natural polymer composites, prioritizing mechanics and fabrication for now,
          while aiming to develop tailored functional properties in the long run.
        </p>

          Beyond the natural sciences, no element is more integral to my human experience than music. I sing and play the oud (<em>ʿūd</em>).
          Whether harmonizing with choirs or jamming in a traditional Kuwaiti <em>samrah</em>, or sharing stage with Eastern and Western ensembles,
          I immerse myself in music wherever I tread. I am currently deepening my study of Arab music theory while advancing my oud technique.
